        Badrap is a Finnish information security startup, spiced up with Estonian drive to "just do it". We are seasoned infosec
        professionals with skills to build products and serve governmental customers. We would like to talk to governmental actors
        who wish to reach the victims of online crime and owners of vulnerable devices - in scale! We are building an information
        security marketplace which aims for unprecedented impact when it comes to reducing vulnerable devices in the net.
        An Airbnb for security information, if you will.
      </p>

      <p>Are you interested in new ways to raise awareness and warn the victims? 
        We would love to talk. Give us early feedback and make sure our solution 
        will work for you!
