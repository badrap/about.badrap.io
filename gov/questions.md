# BADRAP QUESTIONNAIRE FOR GOV

## Responder Background

* My organisation is tasked to look after the cyberspace
* My organisation already collects threat intelligence about our country
* My organisation shares the information we collect to the network owners

## Product Fit for Gov

5 = Very true, 1 = Not at all true

### Mandate

We help:

* the netizens
* other governmental organisations
* a specific critical sector of our country (finance, defence)
* something else:_____________

### General Points of View and Priorities

* The owners of vulnerable devices need to be warned. There is no way around it.
* People using the Internet via vulnerable devices (routers, captive portals, vpn servers, etc) need to be warned
* Everyone should have equal access to the informtion about their own vulnerabilities (enterprises, small businesses, individuals)
* Io protect the Internet and it's key services, we must pay attention to the devices connected to Internet, (Help the tree by helping it's leafs)

### Focus on Netizens

Netizen is an online citizen, who takes care of connected devices at home,
for friends and family, or in small businesses.

* It is important to notify netizens if they have vulnerable devices
* It is important to provide an opportunity for netizen to check if they have vulnerabilities
* It is important to notify netizens if their devices are participating in an attack
* I would like to have the capability to notify the netizens

### Focus on Businesses

* Critical Infrasturcture Enterprises need to pay themselves for the access to vulnerability information. The government should have no part in it.
* Large Enterprises need to pay themselves for the access to the vulnerability information.
* Small & Medium businesses need to pay themselves for the access to the vulnerability information.

### Focus on Security Researcher

In Badrap context, the Security Researcher refers to anyone with the knowledge of security
issues in network assets (IP-addresses, domain names, emails).

* It is important that anyone with the knowledge about security vulnerabilities should have
  low barrier to making their findings available to the ones having those vulnerabilities

### Current Efforts and Desired State

Y/N

* We conduct cyber awareness campaigns aimed at citizens
* We conduct cyber awareness campaigns aimed at businesses
* We make our threat intelligence available for the network owners
* We ask the network owners (for example ISPs) to forward our information to who it may concern
* We aim to scale up our reach significantly
* We believe a technical solution designed for maximum reach would help a lot
* We believe that better messaging designed to expand the scope beyond security professional would help a lot

## Budgetary

We intend to keep the service free for individuals. This section collects feedback
for different alternatives to fund the technology and in future to compensate the
future security researchers.

* Given that our requirements (technical and/or our own resourcing) would be met,
  my organisation's budget would allow:
  * sponsoring a third party service where netizens could check their vulnerabilities
  * providing (paying) a service where netizens could check their vulnerabilities
  * assigning bounties for the security researchers (the following year)
  * paying for a service setup, where businesses could check their vulnerabilities

## Resources

This section collects feedback on what support resources you have in-house, and
what should be provided by us.

* We have messaging experts who are used to communicate to crowds
* We have a following which we can use to promote our work

We can raise awareness through different media:

* Social media
* Ads
* Events

## Followup

* [Â ] I would like to hear about your findings
* [ ] I would like to talk and see if we could collaborate
