## Create an account

Hi. I'm Jani and I'm going to show you how to register to Badrap.

Click login, then go to Register an account

Type in your primary aemail address

Then Badrap asks you to verify your account

Go and check your email

Click Activate

Input a strong password. You can use your browsers password feature, if you
have one.

Confirm

Congratulations. You're done!

## Claim and name assets

Now that you have an account, you can claim assets. In Badrap, the word asset means your
digital identities. IP-addressess, email-addresses and so forth. When you claim
one, you are able to receive security warnings related to those assets.

So lets go ahead and claim our home IP-address. Right now, I have a thumbs up
for my home address. But what if something is found later on? By adding my home
IP address to my assets, I can get email warnings if something is found later on.
That way, I don't need to visit Badrap all the time.

Then I'm going to name the asset. Once I have more of them, I want to remember
which is which. I'm going to name it as... "Home".

And its done. My home IP is now on "my assets" list. Now, I'm{} able to get email
warnings, if security researchers later on report issues related to my home IP.

## Enable Data Breach Monitoring

Next I'm going to show you how to turn on the {data breach monitoring. It allows you
to get warnings and instructions about data breaches that concern also you.

I click my user name from the top right corner... and go to account settings.
Then I'm going to click on the "Have I been Pwned".

And that's it. From now on, you will also get a warning and instructions, if "Have I been Pwned"
service learns that your personal data has leaked from somewhere.

## Warnigs

...

We already see the status of my home network, the one I'm using right now.

A bit below, in the Events section I see I have this "Open Telnet" issue.

I could open it to get more
information, but I decide to take a birds-eye view across all my assets first.

Hmm, there is a report related to my email address. Lets have a look.

A Data Breach called "Colletion #1".

I open it to see the description. And I could read more at docs.badrap.io,
but I decide to take a look at the other report first. I go back to My Assets.

I click on my home IP. The same "Open Telnet" report is available under that page.

Hmm.. Telnet, that age-old internet service, which should no longer even
exist. That doesn't sound
right. I wonder what I could do about it. I do have this link pointing to
further instructions. But I think I'll ask my friend Jukke about this. He's a
computer wizard.

And that's how you check warnings in badrap. Click an asset in the asset list,
see the short description, and if you don't know what to do, follow the
link to docs.badrap.io, or invite your unsuspecting computer-wizard friend to
stop by for a coffee.
