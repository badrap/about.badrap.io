                    <p>
                            Bad guys hack normal people in order to hide their tracks online.
                            They break into your devices or use them to bounce attacks towards others. They also
                            break in to the services you use and steal personal data. We provide ways for security researchers
                            and enterprises to alert you, if your device has been hacked or your data has been stolen.

            <h2>Vulnerable Devices</h2>
            <p>We have a localized solution to alert netizens (citizens on the net). 
                We opened in Finland with a service called <a href="https://testaaverkkosi.fi"> CheckYourNet</a>.
                We attrack users with social media ads and content marketing. Netizens use the service
                to check if security researchers have reported issues in the IP-addresses they use to connect to the Intenret. 
                If this is the case, netizen gets a human-understandable description of the problem, as well as remediation
                instructions. We also provide pointers to commercial help, if the user does can not fix the issues themself.

            <h2>Leaked Information</h2>
            <p> Bad guys hack Internet-services to steal private information. 
                Emails, passwords, credit card numbers and so on. In Europe, they
                are compelled by regulation to notify your personal information has leaked.
                In U.S, companies get gigantic fines and end up doing settlements when they 
                don't act diligently in the data breaches. We help enterprises to notify you
                when they must. We provide them the means to help you to understand what happened.
