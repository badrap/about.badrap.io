                        Smart security researchers scan the Internet to find the devices
                        the bad guys can hack. Internet attacks get also noticed by streetwise
                        victims. They want the attacks to stop and try to report the
                        attacks. We are working on a way to help victims and researchers
                        to alert you if they find out that your devices could be hacked.
