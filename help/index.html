          What is Badrap trying to solve?
        </h1>
        <p>
          Netizens read news about vulnerabilities in their devices all the time. They are worried if their own networks or the networks
          of their loved ones, workplaces or friends are affected. For some vulnerabilities there may be ways to check if you are
          affected, but this is not always the case.</p>
        <p>
          Investigating requires too much time and expertise to make it generally viable
          even for netizens who have some technical knowledge. It is even harder for regular users, who may not even know that the
          problem exists. With Badrap, netizens and end users can check if their devices and networks need to be fixed. Badrap can
          also point users to helpers, who can assist in fixing the problems.

        <h4>What can I do to help?</h4>
        <p>
          You are researching vulnerabilities or gathering knowledge about incidents or infections. You already have some data about
          devices which might be affected. Optimally you have done some scans or observed traffic coming from infected hosts, and you
          know about some IP addresses that are affected by certain vulnerabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, you may not have an easy way to reach the network or device owners directly and help them fix their problems. Perhaps
          you have been thinking of creating a Heartbleed-style website to talk about your findings. Perhaps you are working with a
          CERT organization. Perhaps you plan to tweet about what you found and hope someone famous enough retweets your story.
        </p>
        <p>
          Badrap changes the last mile in vulnerability coordination: we provide a channel so that you can directly tell about the
          problem to people that are affected. Netizens can easily check if their IP address is found within your data. You get to
          feed your findings to netizens, provide instructions on how to fix the problems, and help the world become a better place.
          You help netizens in a concrete and tangible way, and ensure your hard work ultimately goes to a good cause.

        <h4>How do I provide data?</h4>

        <p>
          It's simple. You let us know that you have some interesting data that you want to provide to netizens. We will provide you
          a way to write some metadata about your feed. Metadata means simple things like feed name, description, and remediation instructions
          for netizens. We will then send you an API token and some instructions on uploading. Then you can just push your data as
          JSON to our API endpoint with nghttp, curl, whatever you like. At a minimum, each entry in your feed should contain an IP
          address and timestamp.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use the form below to tell us about your data.

          <a class="btn btn-info" href="https://goo.gl/Lfa67y" target="_blank" role="button">Tell us about your data</a>
        </p>

        <h4>What's the catch?</h4>
        <p>
          No catch. We don't plan to take money from you or the netizens. We don't plan to sell your data to third parties. We just
          want to try if something like this is useful, and if it makes the world a better place. We plan to test the service for netizens
          with a limited pilot at <a href="https://testaaverkkosi.fi">https://testaaverkkosi.fi</a>
          on Jan-Feb 2018.
