##### A new TV series inspired Badrap.io and Remod Oy to launch a community effort to rid Finland of insecure building automation systems.

The Finnish national broadcasting company Yle recently aired a new Docstop series called “Team Whack - everything can be hacked”. In its first episode the team’s researchers found over 1000 openly accessible Fidelix building automation systems in Finland. The team subsequently demonstrated the involved risks by taking over and remotely controlling one neighbourhood's building automation, including the yard lights and heating.

The episode inspired Oulu-based Badrap.io to contact and assist parties that are actively using insecurely installed Fidelix building automation systems in Finland. The need for such a push was made clear by Fidelix's aired statement that security patches seldom find their way to devices in the field.

Badrap set a bounty for a method to warn the owners of the vulnerable devices. The computer security experts of Remod Oy took up the challenge. Based on publicly available information they identified the vulnerable Finnish network addresses to contact those in danger. The same list is also provided to the Badrap.io service, so that anyone concerned about the security of their own network or devices can run the necessary tests to see that if they are vulnerable. The test is publicly available at <https://badrap.io>.

Badrap aims to fix this situation by providing a system through which information about similar vulnerabilities and their fixes could effectively be communicated between manufacturers, security experts and end users. “_The Internet is full of vulnerable devices. Owners of most of these have no experience in computer security. We want to make security an easily approachable thing for everyone, and this campaign is one step towards that_”, Jani Kenttälä of Badrap.io describes their motivation.
