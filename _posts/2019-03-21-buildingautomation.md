##### A new TV series inspired two companies to launch a community effort to rid Finland of insecure building automation systems.

The Finnish national broadcasting company Yle recently aired a new Docstop series called “Team Whack - everything can be hacked”. In its first episode Team Whack found over 1000 openly accessible Fidelix building automation systems in Finland. The team subsequently demonstrated the involved risks by taking over and remotely controlling one neighbourhood's building automation, including yard lights, ventilation and heating.

The episode inspired Oulu-based information security company Badrap Ltd. to contact and assist parties that are actively using insecurely installed Fidelix building automation systems in Finland. The need for such a push was made clear by Fidelix's aired statement that security patches seldom find their way to devices in the field.

Badrap set a bounty for a method to warn the owners of the vulnerable devices, and computer security experts of Remod Ltd. took up the challenge. Based on publicly available information Remod identified the vulnerable Finnish network addresses to contact those in danger. The companies also made their findings available at <https://badrap.io> so that anyone can check their own network, for free.

“_The Internet is full of vulnerable devices. Owners of most of these have no experience in computer security. We want to make security an easily approachable thing for everyone, and this campaign is one step towards that_”, Badrap.io CEO Jani Kenttälä describes their motivation.
