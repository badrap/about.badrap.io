## EU Cyber Security Awareness Month Begins - Check the Security of Your Networks with an Easy Test

As part of the EU Cyber Security Awareness Month in October, Finnish security company Badrap Ltd encourages all Internet users to check the security of the networks they use with a simple test. As the theme for the first week of the cyber security awareness month is Practicing Basic Cyber Hygiene, anyone needs to be able to take care of their personal network security on a daily basis. Using the simple but innovative test Badrap has developed, you can check if symptoms of security weaknesses have been detected in the networks that you like to use. You can check any network that you are using - your own, your relatives, friends, workplace, school or university, favourite cafe or restaurant, or any other network that you use regularly or occasionally. Security observations about your networks are based on signs of security problems, which can be detected from traffic sent out to the Internet from infected or compromised devices. You can test your network for free at <https://badrap.io> . The service will remain freely usable also in the future, after the EU Cyber Security Awareness Month ends.

Badrap helps Internet users and companies receive already-existing and timely security research information about the security of their networks and devices, without the need to purchase or install any security solutions or complex software applications. Home users and security professionals in Finland and elsewhere have been using the service before its EU-wide launch. They have identified numerous vulnerable or misconfigured devices in the networks they use in their homes, workplaces and elsewhere. One of our early users describes their experience with the service like this: “My new router had a DNS service open to the Internet by accident. I got an automatic alert about the vulnerability through Badrap, and I could fix the problem quickly before there was any damage. As a security professional I value the fact that I can get information about misconfigurations and vulnerabilities immediately and clearly, and that I do not have to install anything extra into my network.”
