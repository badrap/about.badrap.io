## EU Cyber Security Awareness Month Begins - Check the Security of Your Network with an Easy Test

A simple test can reveal if the networks you use suffer from security problems. You can check the security of any network for free at <https://badrap.io>.

EU Cyber Security Awareness Month begins on October 1. The theme for the first week is Practicing Basic Cyber Hygiene, meaning how anyone can take care of their security as part of daily life.

Finnish security company Badrap Ltd encourages all Internet users to check the security of the networks they use. With the simple but innovative test Badrap has developed, you can check if symptoms of security weaknesses have been detected in the networks that you like to use.

“Security observations about your networks are based on signs of security problems, which can be detected from traffic sent out to the Internet from infected or compromised devices”, says Jani Kenttälä, CEO of Badrap.

You can test any network for free at <https://badrap.io>. The service will remain freely usable also in the future, after the EU Cyber Security Awareness Month ends.

You can check any network that you are using - your own, your relatives, friends, workplace, school or university, favourite cafe or restaurant, or any other network that you use regularly or occasionally.

“Our service tells the user if any security problems have been detected in the networks that the user is interested in, and what kind of problems they are. We also provide simple instructions how to fix the problems,” Kenttälä explains.

Badrap helps Internet users and companies receive already-existing and timely security research information about the security of their networks and devices, without the need to purchase and install separate security appliances or complex software applications.

Home users and security professionals in Finland and elsewhere have been using the service before its EU-wide launch. They have identified numerous vulnerable or misconfigured devices in the networks they use in their homes, workplaces and elsewhere.

One user describes their experience with the service like this: “My new router had a DNS service open to the Internet by accident. I got an automatic alert about the vulnerability through Badrap, and I could fix the problem quickly before there was any damage. As a security professional I value the fact that I can get information about misconfigurations and vulnerabilities immediately and clearly, and that I do not have to install anything extra into my network.”
