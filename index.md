## Did you attack someone?

Internet attacks get noticed by streetwise victims. They want the attacks to stop
and try to report the attacks. We are working on a way for you to know if attacks
come from the places you use to connect to the Internet.

## Can you be turned into an attacker?

Your devices can.
Smart reseachers scan the Internet to find devices that can be turned into attackers.
We are working on a way to help them to alert you if they find out something you should
fix in order not be turned into an attacker.
