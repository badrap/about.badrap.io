## Did you attack someone?

Streetwise victims of Internet attacks collect information about attackers. We are
working on a way for you to check if any of the victims has reported attacks coming
from the network addresses you use to connect to the Internet.

## Can you be turned into an attacker?

Smart reseachers scan the Internet to find devices that can be turned into attackers.
We are working on a way to help them to alert your if they find out something you should
fix in order not be turned into an attacker.
