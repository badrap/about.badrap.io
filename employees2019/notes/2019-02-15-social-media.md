# Notes

## Quick look at current web

We took a brief look at the [cyber hygiene landing
page](https://about.badrap.io/employees). There are pending improvements, but
the goal was to just get it out and start getting feedback.

* Main page - security researchers last?

## Getting our message out

We've started b2b contacting. This session was about online reach.

* Find relevant facebook groups
* Try also using local language
  * Make company updates and share with groups with your personal view.
* Remember - linkedin cuts the message
* Remember the tags
* Linkedin ADs - automated bid + daily budget good combo (main point, use
  automated bit)
* Networking challenges in LinkedIn expands your reach.
