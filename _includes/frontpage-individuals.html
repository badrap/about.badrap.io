            <p>We have a localized solution to alert netizens (citizens on the net). 
               We opened in Finland with a service called <a href="https://testaaverkkosi.fi"> CheckYourNet</a>.
               We attrack users with social media ads and content marketing. Netizens use the service
               to check if security researchers have reported issues in the IP-addresses they use to connect to the Intenret. 
               If this is the case, netizen gets a human-understandable description of the problem, as well as remediation
               instructions. We also provide pointers to commercial help, if the user does can not fix the issues themself.

            <h3>Has my data leaked?</h3>
            <p> Bad guys hack Internet-services to steal private information. 
                Emails, passwords, credit card numbers and so on. In Europe, they
                are compelled by regulation to notify your personal information has leaked.
                In U.S, companies get gigantic fines and end up doing settlements when they 
                don't act diligently in the data breaches. We help companies to notify you
                when they must. We provide them the means to help you to understand what happened.
