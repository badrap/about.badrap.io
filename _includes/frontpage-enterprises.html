                    Data breaches handled like a pro
                </h3>

                <p>
                    When enterprises suspect a data breach, there are a number of things to hoops they
                    need to go through. They need to verify if the breach is legit. Incident responders
                    need to figure out how the breach was possible and how to prevent it in the future. 
                    They need to figure out the scope: what data and who was affected. How much the systems
                    can be trusted? The list goes on. Now, GDPR defines new steps and a timeframe to notify
                    you.
