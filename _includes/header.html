                <p class="mb-10">Bad guys hack normal people in order to hide their 
                    tracks online. Smart security researchers scan the Internet
                    to find the devices the bad guys can hack. Internet attacks get 
                    also noticed by streetwise victims. They want
                    the attacks to stop and try to report the attacks. We are working 
                    on a way to help victims and researchers to
                    alert you if they find out that your devices could be hacked.
