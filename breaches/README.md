Data breaches happen on daily basis. Hundreds of companies leak billions of customer records left and right. 
Criminals take the leaked information and use it to attack others. 
Individuals need to be made aware when their data is leaked to prevent further damage. 
Internet-services like Have I Been Pwned do a great job in spreading awareness and providing
tools to check if your data has been leaked. 
But we are far from the scale needed for coping with data breaches on a global scale.
On our quest for the scale, Employee Cyber Hygiene is the first step to make coping with data breaches a routine for the people.
