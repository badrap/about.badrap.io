    heading: Enable Two-Factor Authentication
    text: >
      More and more services offer two-factor authentication, also called as multi-factor authentication - sometimes
      shortened as 2FA or MFA.
      Enable it whenever possible. With it, having your username password is not enough to get access to the service.
      See the example instructions by <a href="https://www.google.com/landing/2step/" target="_blank">Google</a>
      and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/148233965247823" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.
      Add emergency contact information so that you can get your account back, should something happen.

    heading: Use Password Managers
    text: >

      <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/" target="_blank">LastPass</a>, and
