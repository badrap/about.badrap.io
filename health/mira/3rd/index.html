    heading: Be smart with smart devices
    text: >
      TV's, light bulbs, security cameras, and many other devices are now smart and online. Some manufacturers may
      look for the cheapest means to get their devices online, and that is bad news for the security.
      Think about what could happen if someone got access to the data they produce. Read about their capabilities. Netamo weather station
      also measures background noise - so it must have a microphone. Can you access your security camera's feed from the Internet? Maybe
      someone else could too? Place the devices with cameras and microphones in a way they have minimal impact on your privacy.
  - First:
    heading: Check your networks
    text: >
      Denial of Service Attacks against popular Internet-services, such as Netflix makes the news.
      The news rarely explains why these attacks are possible. The devices people connect to the Internet
      may have security vulnerabilities. Criminals search for masses of these vulnerable devices and use them to attack others.
      They either take over the device for the attack or use it to amplify their attack traffic.  Complete phase 3 mission to check
      if security researchers have reported issues for the devices in the networks you care about.
  - Second:
    heading: Protect your personal devices
    text: >
      Your phone, tablet and computer get automatic updates to remove vulnerabilities, so criminals often try to
      get you to compromise your computer's security. Good cyber hygiene practices are critical.
      Criminals make a lot of money by extorting people and companies.
      They may encrypt files and demand money for unlocking them (ransomware). They may record your activities and
      threaten to release their material, or just fake that they have something (extortion).
      Last time you learned how criminals exploit trust relationships. Be suspicious
      even with the messages which appear to be coming from your friends or colleagues.

      During this month you have learned why your online safety matters and how to protect your personal
      information online. If you need to refresh your memory, all materials are available <a href="../">here.</a>
      This time you will learn if the networks you use to connect to the Internet have devices that can be hacked,
      or have already been hacked and used to attack others. Completing phase 3 mission unlocks bonus material
      with more tips for protecting yourself.
  - Mission:
    subheading: Your phase 3 mission
    text: >
      Your mission is to check the networks you use at badrap.io. Badrap.io has information about vulnerable
      and compromised devices connected to the Internet. You can use your account at badrap.io to check that
      there is no known trouble in places you connect from. Start with your home. Connect your personal device,
      such as your smartphone to your home WiFi network. Visit badrap.io and check the results for your
      network IP-address. If you see a warning, follow the instructions. Save the IP with
      "Save asset" -button to get email warnings in the future.

  - How:
    subheading: Make it a habit
    text: >
      Just like in the real world, good habits lay out the foundation for good online health. It is not easy to
      change habits, but we all have learned to brush our teeth and wash our hands. In the online world,
      automation picks up our practices over time. For example, software updates are mostly
      automatic these days. Create a habit of visiting badrap.io once per month. Your cue is the monthly "All good" -email.
      Revisit badrap.io from networks you care about to see if your IP-addresses have changed.
      Also, add any new email you might have created since your last visit.
