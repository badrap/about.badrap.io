  - First:
    heading: Guard the most assets - win three movie tickets
    text: >
      Become a guardian of as many IP-addresses and email addresses you can. We will reward the employee
      who guards most assets.
      Check from the top of the "My Assets" page how many assets you are guarding right now.
  - Second:
    heading: Be a good mentor - win two movie tickets
    text: >
      Being a good mentor starts by realising why security is everybody's business. We want to reward those
      who have taken a moment to consider the topics of this month. We will analyse your answers and
      reward best answers with movie tickets. Both single answers and consistent activity qualify.
  - Third:
    heading: Stay safe in the future
    text: >
      This is the last mission of the cyber health month. After you have completed, keep using badrap.io to get warnings
      also in the future. It will not spam you - 98% of our users keep their email notifications enabled.
      We will contact the winners separately, using the email you have provided in your answers. The Cyber Health Month
      ends at 1.7 12:00 GMT+3.

    heading: Become a Guardian, a Mentor, or both

      You have learned how your personal security can affect others, as criminals exploit trust relationships to scam others.
      Now let's turn that around. Be a mentor for someone by talking with your colleagues about Cyber Health Month. Or become
      a guardian by claiming assets that are relevant to those you can help. If you haven't had yet time to read the material,
      it is not too late - start with the button below. You still have time to learn and an opportunity to win rewards.

    img-text: Claim assets that are relevant to those you can help.
    text: >
      Become a guardian by checking networks
      (IP-addresses) and email addresses that are relevant to those you can help.
      Criminals can find the same information as our researchers do, so it is essential to reach anyone with issues.
      Who could you help? At home: email addresses of your family members.
      If you find an issue related to your family member, read the instructions together or contact us for help.
      On the road: the guest WiFi at the hotel you are staying.
      While working: the guest WiFi in a business meeting. If you find a
      vulnerability from the guest WiFi, tell about it to your host, reception staff or similar
      and ask them to report it to their service provider. You can
      also ask them to contact us, and
      we will explain the issue without an extra cost. Just ask them to tell us that the tip came from you.
  - How:
    subheading: Become a mentor by talking with your colleagues
    text: >
      This is a good topic for small talk. Chat with your colleagues about Cyber Health Month. Ask colleagues at a coffee or a lunch break
      if they have noticed the campaign. Have they participated? What have they learned? Did they use badrap.io or just read the material?
      You don't need to be an expert in the topics you have learned.
      A simple reminder from you to participate might save their day in the future.
