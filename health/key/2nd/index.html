  - First:
    heading: Attacking Other Services
    text: >
      27% of us use the same or similar password in different services. Criminals buy or steal usernames and passwords
      to run automated attacks against other services. Make their life harder by using unique passwords in
      every service. Pay special attention to your email accounts as they can be used to reset the passwords of other services.
  - Second:
    heading: Scamming People You Know
    text: >
      You might have heard about scams where criminals get someone to transfer money to their own accounts. These attacks work
      because they are timed well and they look credible. Criminals like to
      get hold of email accounts and monitor the email-traffic to study the target and wait for the right opportunity.
      Make sure your email account password is not used anywhere else.

  - Third:
    heading: Scamming Others With Your Personal Information
    text: >
      While Internet services and smartphone apps may have legit reasons to collect your personal information, problems arise
      when the organisations don't adequately protect the data they collect. Criminals can take this information and impersonate you while
      scamming others.
      Treat personal information like money. Give it away only when necessary. Remove unnecessary personal details
      such as your birthday and home address from online services. When a smart-phone app asks permission to personal information, such as
      your contacts or location data, deny it when ever you can.

      Last week you learned that criminals could use stolen information to conduct further attacks.
      This week you will learn what those further attacks are - and the easiest ways to protect yourself.
      Completing this week's mission unlocks bonus material. You can read it at your own time to learn more ways
      to protect yourself.
  - Mission:
    subheading: Your mission this week
    text: >
      Your mission this week is to become aware if you are affected by any of the known data breaches.
      Think what all the email addresses you have used to register to different Internet services.
      Add them to your asset list
      with "add email" -button (see the image above). Badrap.io sends a verification email to each address.
      You can add your family's addresses too. Just ask them if they are willing to verify their emails for you.
      Addresses and results appear in your asset list after the verification.

  - How:
    subheading: How data breach check is possible
    text: >
      Security researchers find stolen personal information being sold on the Internet. They also find Internet services which
      accidentally expose personal information to the public. They submit their findings to
      a reputable service called Have I Been Pwned, where you can check with your email address if you are affected.
      Have I Been Pwned is one of the badrap.io's data sources. Remember to turn it on (see the image below).
