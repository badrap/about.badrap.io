            <h3>Mission briefing</h3>
            <p>
                You are here because you are one of the top 5 participants so far. You have been active, and
                your answers show that you have given thought for the topics of the month. Great job! You would make an excellent
                mentor for someone!
            </p>
            <p>
                Would you help with the final push? <strong>15 new participants</strong>
                will guarantee the best possible grade for your company. It makes three participants each
                if you spread the work evenly.
            </p>
            <p>     Get as many employees as possible through the finish line.
                    Every completion counts and 15 new participants guarantee the best possible score for the employer.

                The key to success is to find those who would like to participate but have not yet done so. Some may
                    have just missed the emails. A simple reminder, in this case, can be enough. Some may have planned to participate
                    but forgot or didn't find the right time. Now your skills are needed! Offer your help. Completing the mission
                    together could be twice as fast and guarantees the job will get done. Also, the messenger is important -
                    a real-world encounter works better than emails.

            <h3>Mission stats</h3>
            <p> We are looking for additional participants on top of the current ones. We will be watching
                the completions and update this page at least once per day. New people can start from <a href="../">here</a>.
