  - First:
    heading: Protect most assets, get F-Secure Sense
    text: >
      The SENSE router gives you fast WiFi while protecting all web surfing in your home.
      It blocks malicious websites and other threats, and secures all your smart devices
      against cyber attacks. Unlike normal router, SENSE is constantly and automatically updated.
      Become a guardian of as many IP-addresses and email addresses as you can to win this item.
      Remember to give your consent in this week's mission for us to check your asset count.
  - Second:
    heading: Movie tickets to best answers
    text: >
      We said in the beginning you don't need to be an security expert to win. Better online safety
      is a journey and we want to reward those who walk the walk. We will analyse your answers and
      give a total of ten movie tickets to those who gave the best answers. We may reward single answers
      from a specific week, or consistent activity, or both.

  - Third:
    heading: Stay safe in the future
    text: >
      Your Cyber Health Month is getting near. Keep using badrap.io to get warnings also
      in the future. You will get one more email which wraps up the month. We will contact
      the winners separately, using the email you have provided in your answers.

  - Ingress:
    heading: Become a Guardian, a Mentor, or Both.
    text: >
      You have learned how your personal security can affect others, as criminals exploit trust relationships to scam others.
      Now think it the other way around: by helping people you trust to stay safe, you also help yourself. Additionally,
      talking to others about what you have learned helps you to remember the lessons longer.

  - Mission:
    subheading: Your mission this week
    text: >
      Ready to move to the next level? Become a guardian. Claim also assets that are relevant to the people you care about. Email addresses of your
      family members, the guest WiFi at the hotel you are staying, or the one in a business meeting. If you find an issue related to your family member, read
      the instructions together with your family member or contact us for help. If you find a vulnerability from the guest WiFi, tell the host or reception
      and ask them to report it to their provider. You can also give our
      contact details to them. If they contact us before 26.5, we will explain the issue without an extra cost as a thank you for
      your participance. Just ask them to tell us the tip came from you. They should also write down the IP address and the name of the warning - or simply
      visit badrap.io from that WiFi to see it themselves.
  - How:
    subheading: Become a mentor
    text: >
      Talk with your colleagues about the Cyber Health Month. Ask colleagues at a coffee or lunch break
      if they have noticed the campaign. Have they participated? What they have learned? You don't need to be an expert in the topics you have learned.
      A simple reminder from you to participate might save their day in the future. They still have time to go for the rewards.
