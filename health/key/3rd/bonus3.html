    heading: Update your home router's software
    text: >
      Computers get automatic updates. Unfortunately, this is rarely the case with home routers.
      Check your home router's manual to see how you can log into it. If your manual is missing, try searching
      the Internet with using the brand, model and the term "manual" as keywords. Example: <em>huawei b593s-22
      manual</em>. Log in and browse through the settings. Check if you can update the firmware of the router to fix
      any potential vulnerabilities. Search for keywords such as "firmware update" or just "update".
      What other smart devices you could update?

    heading: Secure the router settings
    text: >
      Once you have updated your router, secure the settings. Search for the settings related to how your router shows up
      on the Internet. Look for keywords such as "Internet" or "WAN" or "Services". Disable unnecessary services, such as
      Samba or SMB, FTP, or telnet. There are few services that you need inside your network, but you don't want to keep them open
      to the Internet: NTP and DNS. If you disable them, try to figure out from the router's admin interface if they
      are open only for your own network, or also to the Internet. Finally, find if the router has a firewall. Look for keywords
      such as "Security" or "Firewall". You should usually be able to use the highest security settings at home.

    heading: Use ad blockers in your personal devices
    text: >
      Ad blockers are designed to block tracking and remove ads from web pages you view. They are good for privacy, and
      they have a positive effect for security. They make it more difficult for criminals to push malicious programs into
      your devices through ads and third party javascript. Get the ad blockers from reputable download sources. For example,
      uBlock Origin is available at the
      <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en">
        Chrome browser's Web Store</a>, and
        1Blocker is available for iPhones at <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1blocker-x-faster-safer-web/id1365531024?mt=8">App Store</a>

    heading: Check your network IP-address at Shodan
    text: >
      Security researchers report about specific vulnerabilities. Shodan.io service scans the Internet regularly for all
      open services, not just the vulnerable ones. Use shodan.io to make sure
      you don't have any services accessible from the Internet. They could be found vulnerable in the future. Go to the
      "Home" tab in
      <a href="https://badrap.io">badrap.io</a> (see the image below) and see what your current IP-address is. Then go to
      <a href="https://shodan.io">shodan.io </a>
      and search your IP address. If you get results, remember that these are not necessarily vulnerabilities. Just services,
      which could be found vulnerable in the future.
