        Others depend on you to stay safe. Criminals can use your devices and personal information to attack others.
        Make sure that your data or devices are not used as stepping stones in any attack.

        Your providers should warn you when your data has been breached. But sometimes they don't.
        Sometimes they don't even notice.
        <a href="badrap.io">badrap.io</a> warns you if security researchers have found your
        information available out in the open.

        IoT-devices often have vulnerabilities. Security researchers scan the
        Internet to find the vulnerabilities before attackers can use them.
        And they monitor where the ongoing attacks are coming from.

        Get started by checking if there are updates for your home router. And make sure it does not use a default password.
        Search the net for further instructions by using keywords such as router's brand, model and manual or security.

        And remember, IoT devices send data to the cloud. The personal information they collect
        can also be breached. Turn those security cameras away from you and your neighbours.

        The personal devices you carry may provide the keys to the kingdom. You may access critical information or
        systems with them. Or you may use them to be in contact with somebody who does.

        Software and operating system vendors try to eradicate vulnerabilities and ship regular updates to
        keep you safe. So criminals often try to scam you to compromise their security.
