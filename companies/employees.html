    description: >

      long: >
        81% of confirmed data breaches involved leveraging weak or stolen
        passwords, says Spycloud. 27% of users recycle passwords, says (HPI).
        Criminals use stolen usernames and passwords in automated attacks
        against companies. Let security researchers warn your employees if
        their passwords are stolen from the services they use in their free
        time.

      long: >
        You care about your employees and security. Let it show! Current
        employees stay longer when they feel appreciated. Future employees
        are more inclined to work with you when they know you care about them.
        And customers will appreciate how far you are willing to go with
        security improvements.

        Badrap service was build for individuals. That is why we
        can provide personal service similar to the occupational health
        services. And that is why your employees can start protecting all their
        assets withouth worrying their employer is watching over.

      morelink: ./employees#perimeter
      long: >
        Employees work from home and on the go. They bring their own devices to
        the their work. Some of them use similar passwords everywhere, so their
        passwords stolen from third parties may be used against you. Protect
        your employees, protect your business.

  heading: Why work with us?
  description: >
    Badrap was founded by security veterans, who have served countries, and critical
    infrastructure organisations for ages. We have witnessed how the Finnish approach
    of collecting and sharing security information with those in danger have helped
    organisations and individuals to stay safe. We've
    seen how other countries adapt to that model. Now we want to make security information
    accessible to everyone, including you and your employees.
