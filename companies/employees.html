        There are plenty of
        security solutions to protect your perimeter and your IT-systems. But
        who takes care of the employees? Protect your employees, protect your businees.

benefits:
    - benefit: Avoid Data Breaches
      tagline: by protecting employee's identities

      long: >
        81% of confirmed data breaches involved leveraging weak or stolen
        passwords, says Spycloud. And no wonder, 27% of users recycle
        passwords, according to HPI. Let security researchers warn your
        employees if their personal information has leaked, or if they have
        security issues at home.

    - benefit: Win hearts and minds
      icon: <i class="far fa-comments fa-5x"></i>
      tagline: You care about security and your employees. Let it show!

      long: >
        Employees stay longer when they feel appreciated. Future employees
        are more inclined to work with you when they know how you care about them.
        Customers appreciate your efforts to keep their data safe.

    - benefit: Preserve employee's privacy
      tagline: Occupational health approach to keep employers safe

            Badrap started off with helping individuals. That is why we
            can provide personal service online, similar to the occupational health.
            And that is why your employees can start protecting all their
            assets withouth worrying their employer is watching over.

    - benefit: Protect outside your perimeter
      tagline: by protecting people who work from home and use their own devices.

      long: >
            You can't ship security solutions to all of your employees
            devices. And you can't prevent your employees information
            leaking from third party services they use.
            But you can empower your employees to stay safe. Badrap lets your
            employees know when they have issues. When they do, we provide
            simple instructions so that they protect themsevles, and you.

whyus:
  heading: Why work with us?
  description: >
    Badrap was founded by security veterans, who have served countries, and critical
    infrastructure organisations for ages. We have witnessed how the Finnish approach
    of collecting and sharing security information with those in danger have helped
    organisations and individuals to stay safe. We've
    seen how other countries adapt to that model. Now we want to make security information
    accessible to everyone, including you and your employees.
