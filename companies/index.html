            <h1>Let security researchers tell you </h1>
            <p><strong>"The only thing missing is the link between you and what
                    they found about you."</strong></p>

            <p>Security researchers already scan your vulnerabilities from all
                your Internet-facing
                infrastructure. They already crawl the dark corners of the net
                to find the data leaks.
                They run honeypots and darknets to see if malicious programs
                try to connect from your
                networks. The only thing missing is the link between you and
                what they found about you. Badrap aims
                to be that link. Spend 30-60 minutes with us. Provide feedback
                about our company offering.
                If you like what you hear, you have an opportunity to join our pilot program.</p>

            <h1>Agenda </h1>
            <p>You will be talking with Jani, one of the founders.
                Jani was a geek when he started his first company back in 2007.
                Since that, he has provided security solutions for governments
                and critical infrastructure companies. 2016 he asked himself: "what about the rest"?
                Now Jani's passion is to provide easy to use security solutions for everyone.
