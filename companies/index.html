                <p>
                    Data breaches are growing at
                        <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/">
                            staggering rate.</a>
                            As nobody is bullet proof, smart players expect the best but prepare for the
                            worst. While the average cost of a data breach is
                            <a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach"> high</a>,
                            quick detction, containment and diligent crisis communication can save
                            a big buck, up to 60% of the breach cost.  Do the right thing for
                            your company and its customers. Prevent and prepare data breaches with us.

                Security Researchers monitor the dark corners of the net, as well as other
                typical places where stolen information gets delivered. With this service,
                you will be monitoring if identities related to your company pop up in
                security researchers' radar. Data breaches have become way more frequent,
                than they used to be, and nobody seems to be safe anymore. If it happens to
                your company, be the first to hear about it and
                let security researchers warn you before the information becomes public.

                Recover from a Data Breach
            </h3>
            <p>
                When companies suspect a data breach, incident response takes most of their
                time. Is the breach actually a breach? How it was possible? Who
                was affected? What leaked, and so forth. Now, with GDPR companies
                have a new set of tasks to take care of and they need to be on top
                of things within 72-hours. Let us help! Get immediate mitigation advice from
                us and get a report which explain the researcher's findings in a level a non-technical
                person understands.
