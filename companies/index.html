            <p>Security researchers already scan vulnerabilities from all
                your Internet-facing infrastructure. They crawl the dark
                corners of the net and
                run honeypots to see if malicious programs
                try to connect out from your networks. The only thing missing is
                the link between you and what they found about you. Could Badrap be that link? </p>

                        Jani was a geek when he started his first company back
                        in 2007.
                        Since that, he has provided security solutions for
                        governments
                        and critical infrastructure companies. 2016 he asked
                        himself:
                        "what
                        about the rest"?
                        Now Jani's passion is to provide easy to use security
                        solutions
                        for
                        everyone.
