      <p>
        Inspired by ScanABC <a href="https://www.scanabc.com/testdrive/">
          Security Startup Test Drive</a> we at Badrap would like to offer
        you a risk-free way to test drive life of
        a security startup entrepreneur.

      <h2>What you'll get out of it</h2>
      <p>
        Experience similar to if you were working on your startup. You
        will get as much freedom and responsibility as you can take. You
        will also see what the founders see. You would be one of us.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h2>What we look for</h2>
        <p> An outgoing, entrepreneur-minded person who currently lives in Oulu. You
          like to take an abstract goal, break it down and turn it into concrete
          actions. You are not afraid to ask for help when you need it. You've been
          around startups before, so you have some understanding about the laws that
          surround startups. Preferably you have also lived outside of Finland to help
          us better reach foreign markets.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 rapgray">
      <h2> What you would do </h2>
      <p> You would have an area of responsibility, but you would get to
        participate
        in all aspects of a startup. Funding, messaging, productisation, trial
        marketing,
        sales, and so forth. You would pair up with Jani, the CEO of the
        company. You would be a peer, not a subordinate.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 rapgray">
      <h2>... in practice</h2>
        <p> You would start with by updating our <a href="https://about.badrap.io/companies/employees.html">Cyber
            Hygiene for Employees</a> -product with Jani and a few outsourced trial
          marketeers.
          Quite soon, you would be listing potential partners, end-customers and
          ways to reach them.
          You would track progress and collect feedback systematically so that we get
          proof-points on commercial viability.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h2>Timeline </h2>
        <p> We would like you to start as soon as possible, 2019 is almost over! ;) We
          will evaluate the results of our 2019 plan in 2019-10 and adjust our plans
          for 2020 accordingly. At this point also you have a natural checkpoint for
          asssessing what you want to do next.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h2> No strings attached </h2>
      <p> What happens after the test drive, is up to you and our success.
        We are not shy to offer a piece of the pie if it looks you can help
        us grow the pie. If you just want to get the experience, that is also fine.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 rapgray">
      <h2>Why are we doing this</h2>
        <p> At this phase of the company, we need people who are entrepreneur-minded.
          In other words, someone who naturally takes responsibility. This model also
          plays well into our strengths and weaknesses. We like to empower people, e.g.
          let them grow to fit bigger shoes. That means exposing people to as many
          aspects of the company as possible. Being transparent is our second nature.
          The flipside of this approach is that we suck at micro-managing people, so if
          you expect well-defined tasks and day-to-day instructions on what to do, you
          need to wait until we grow and hire managers.</p>

    <div class="col-md-6 rapgray">
      <h2> Who are we </h2>
      <p> We are security startup veterans each with 10-20 years of experience
        on both building security products and companies who sell them. We'd
        love
        to tap into fresh blood and also share our experiences with you.</p>
