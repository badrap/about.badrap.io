      <p>
        Inspired by the ScanABC <a href="https://www.scanabc.com/testdrive/">
          Security Startup Test Drive</a>, we at Badrap would like to offer
        you a risk-free way to test drive life of
        a security startup entrepreneur.

      <h2>What you'll get out of it</h2>
      <p>
        Experience similar to if you were working on your startup. On this
        drive you will get to live through product validation, go-to-market and funding phases.
        You will get as much freedom and responsibility as you can take. You
        will have the same visibility as we do. You would be one of us.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h2>What we look for</h2>
        <p> An outgoing, entrepreneur-minded person who currently lives in Oulu. You
          like to take an abstract goal, break it down and turn it into concrete
          actions. You are not afraid to ask for help when you need it. You've been
          around startups before. You have some understanding of how
          startups roll. Preferably you also have lived outside of Finland to help
          us better reach foreign markets.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 rapgray">
      <h2> What you would do </h2>
      <p> You would have an area of responsibility, but you would get to
        participate
        in all aspects of a startup. Funding, messaging, productisation, trial
        marketing,
        sales, and so forth. You would pair up with Jani, the CEO of the
        company. You would be a peer, not a subordinate.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 rapgray">
      <h2>... in practice</h2>
        <p> You would start with by updating our <a href="https://about.badrap.io/companies/employees.html">Cyber
            Hygiene for Employees</a> product with Jani and a few outsourced trial
            marketeers.
            Quite soon, you will find yourself thinking of potential partners, end-customers and
            ways to reach them. And when you do reach them, with our support, you'll get to
            work cases with them. You would track progress and collect feedback
            systematically so that we get proof-points on commercial viability.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h2>Timeline </h2>
        <p> We would like you to start as soon as possible, 2019 is almost over! ;) We
          will evaluate the results of our 2019 plan in 2019-10 and adjust our plans
          for 2020 accordingly. At this point, also you have a natural checkpoint for
          assessing what you want to do next.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h2> No strings attached </h2>
      <p> What happens after the test drive, is up to you and our success.
        We are not shy to offer a piece of the pie if it looks you can help
        us grow the pie. If you just want to get the experience, that is also fine.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 rapgray">
      <h2>Why are we doing this</h2>
        <p> At this phase of the company, we need people who are entrepreneur-minded.
          We need people who are used to taking responsibility. Startup Test Drive -model also
          plays well into our strengths and weaknesses. We like to empower people, e.g.
          let them grow to fit bigger shoes. That means being inclusive and exposing people to as many
          aspects of the company as possible. The flipside of this approach is
          that we suck at (micro)managing people. But that should be fine as the type of person
          we are looking right now prefers trust, freedom and responsibility
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 rapgray">
      <h2> Who are we </h2>
      <p> We are security startup veterans each with 10-20 years of experience
        on both building security products and companies who sell them. We'd
        love to tap into fresh blood and also share our experiences with you.
